###  Highlights:
* **Broadcom’s growth outlook remains optimistic, supported by accelerating AI-driven demand and strong hyperscale customer relationships. I recommend a Neutral/Hold stance, reflecting Broadcom’s strong positioning within AI infrastructure.**
* **Management has recently raised its revenue outlook compared with last year. Broadcom projects approximately $19.1 billion in net revenue for Q1 FY2026, compared with $14.6 billion reported in Q1 FY2024, implying 28% year-over-year growth driven by AI-related demand and software monetization.**
* **OpenAI and Broadcom announce strategic collaboration. Broadcom’s strategic collaboration with OpenAI on AI accelerators enhances its exposure to next-generation AI directly competing with Nvidia.**
* **VMware acquisition in 2023 enhanced recurring revenue and margins. The addition of VMware significantly increased software revenue mix, improving earnings stability, cash flow predictability, and valuation support.**
* **Easing financial conditions in 2026. A more supportive U.S. monetary policy backdrop in 2026, could provide a favorable environment for equity valuations.**
* **Ongoing US–China tech restrictions primarily target advanced GPUs rather than networking silicon and custom ASICs**
